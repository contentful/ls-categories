# Contentful Categories Demo
Categorizing your content is important and easy to do in Contentful. This repo contains a simple content model and sample content showing how you can create a categories content type and use it within any exisiting or new content type.

To experiment with this tutorial create an empty space (or new sandbox environment of an existing space) and import the JSON export file into your environment. 

`contentful space import --space-id <your space ID> --content-file ./categories-demo-export.json`

You can watch this [video](https://contentful.wistia.com/medias/59k1p163ze) to see a quick demo of the tutorial.
